Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1</title></head>
<body>
<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1</h1>
<h3><marquee>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a hereditary condition associated with tumors of the endocrine (hormone producing) glands. MEN1 was originally known as Wermer syndrome</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>MEN1 is a genetic condition. This means that the cancer risk and other features of MEN1 can be passed from generation to generation in a family. The gene associated with MEN1 is also called MEN1. A mutation (alteration) in the MEN1 gene gives a person an increased risk of developing endocrine tumors and other symptoms of MEN1. More than 90% of individuals who inherit the MEN1 mutation will develop 1 or more symptoms of MEN1. A small percentage of people without MEN1 genetic alterations have been found to have germline mutations (alterations in the bodyâ€™s egg or sperm cells that become incorporated into the DNA of every cell through inheritance) in a class of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) that regulate cell growth and division. Research is ongoing to learn more about MEN1.</p>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<p>If a person has a family history of MEN1, he or she is suspected of also having MEN1 if diagnosed with a parathyroid, pancreatic, or pituitary tumor. Genetic testing for mutations in the MEN1 gene is available for people suspected to have MEN1. A mutation in the MEN1 gene is found in about 80% to 90% of families diagnosed with MEN1. Approximately 65% of people with 2 or more tumors associated with MEN1, but no family history, will have a mutation in the MEN1 gene. </p>

<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Genetic testing is available. It should be considered for children or young adults who are members of a family diagnosed with MEN1 and an identified mutation of the MEN1 gene to determine which children and young adults should have the screening studies described below. In a family with an identified mutation of the MEN1 gene, children with a genetic test showing no mutation (expected to be 50% of children born to an individual affected with MEN1) may not need the screening tests described below. </li><li>
	<li>Regular blood tests every 1 to 3 years for prolactin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), fasting glucose, insulin, and proinsulin, beginning at age 5 to 10 years.</li><li>

A yearly ionized or albumin-corrected calcium level test, beginning at age 8</li><li>

Regular blood tests for fasting gastrin and fasting and meal stimulated pancreatic polypeptide (PP), fasting VIP, and glucagon, beginning at age 20.</li><li>

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, every 3 to 5 years, beginning between ages 5 to 10, or at any time the results of the tests for serum prolactin or insulin-like growth factor is abnormal.</li><li>

MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen, every 2 to 4 years, beginning at age 20 or when the serum gastrin, PP, or VIP is noted to be abnormal.</li>
</ul>
